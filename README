shymenu will show the menu bar only when the user presses an accelerator 
key. The menu will be hidden again after an item was selected.
shymenu achieves this by defining key maps for those accelerator keys 
(see 'winaltkeys') that would normaly activate a menu.

On a terminal, shymenu will define accelerator keys for the |:emenu| 
command.
